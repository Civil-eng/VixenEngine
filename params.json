The script is setup to run cmake and output a Visual Studio 2015 x64 solution with project files for each subsystem of Vixen Engine. \r\n\r\nAll you need to do is run the configure script and locate the generate solution in the _build directory.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** All dependencies have been included prebuilt targeting x64 with VC++14 compiler in the repository for building on Windows.\r\n\r\n## Linux  CMake\r\n\r\nVixen Engine is being developed on Linux using CMake.\r\n\r\nAll you need to do to setup development for Linux is navigate into the Linux directory of the repo, and run the supplied configure shell script. It will run cmake and output the Makefile to the _build directory which will function as your testbed for development.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** All Vixen libraries will output to **/usr/local/lib** as specified in Makefile.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
